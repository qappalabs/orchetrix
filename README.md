## About

**Orchetrix (OX)** is a powerful and intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) for managing Kubernetes clusters. Designed to simplify container orchestration, Orchetrix provides a centralized and visually rich dashboard to deploy, monitor, and troubleshoot your containerized applications. It serves as a user-friendly alternative to command-line tools like kubectl, offering a more accessible way to interact with your Kubernetes resources. With Orchetrix, you can effortlessly navigate through your namespaces, manage nodes and pods, and visualize the overall architecture of your applications, making Kubernetes management more efficient and approachable for everyone.
