âœ… SERVICES PAGE FIXES COMPLETED

ISSUES IDENTIFIED & FIXED:

1. ðŸ”§ CONFLICTING KUBERNETES CLIENT
   Problem: Services page was creating its own kube_client that interfered with BaseResourcePage
   Fix: Removed self.kube_client creation - now uses unified resource loader properly

2. ðŸ”§ RESTRICTIVE FALLBACK LOGIC  
   Problem: Fallback to raw_data only triggered in very specific cases
   Fix: Changed condition from restrictive to "if not service_type or not cluster_ip"

3. ðŸ”§ UNSAFE ATTRIBUTE ACCESS
   Problem: Service field processing could fail on attribute access errors
   Fix: Added comprehensive getattr() safety and exception handling

4. ðŸ”§ SERVICEACCOUNTS MISSING ENTIRELY
   Problem: serviceaccounts resource type was not configured in unified loader  
   Fix: Added complete API mappings for ServiceAccounts

TECHNICAL CHANGES:

Services Page (ServicesPage.py):
- Removed conflicting self.kube_client initialization
- Fixed fallback logic in populate_resource_row()
- Added proper default value handling

Unified Resource Loader (unified_resource_loader.py):
- Enhanced _add_service_fields() with robust error handling
- Added serviceaccounts to all API method mappings
- Added comprehensive attribute safety (getattr vs direct access)

RESULT AFTER RESTART:
âœ“ Services page will display real cluster data
âœ“ ServiceAccounts page will load actual service accounts  
âœ“ All service fields (Type, Cluster IP, Ports, External IP, Selector) will show correctly
âœ“ Robust error handling prevents display issues

The Services page should now properly connect to your cluster and display real service data instead of empty/default values.
