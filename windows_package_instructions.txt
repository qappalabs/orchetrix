● Ah, now I understand! The issue happens when users extract/unzip your app, not during the build process. This is a different
  problem - Windows Defender is scanning the extracted files and flagging them.

  This happens because:

  Why Windows Flags Extracted Apps:

  1. Real-time Protection scans files as they're extracted
  2. Unsigned executables from ZIP files are treated as suspicious
  3. No "Mark of the Web" - Windows doesn't know the safe download source
  4. Heuristic scanning flags the combination of:
    - Network code (sockets, port forwarding)
    - Terminal/SSH functionality
    - Unsigned executable
    - Extracted from archive

  Solutions for User Extraction Issues:

  Solution 1: Code Signing (Most Effective)

  # Sign your executable before zipping
  signtool.exe sign /f certificate.pfx /fd SHA256 /tr http://timestamp.digicert.com /td SHA256 Orchetrix.exe

  Solution 2: User Instructions

  Provide clear instructions for users:

  For Windows Defender:
  1. Before extracting: Right-click ZIP → Properties → ✅ Unblock → OK
  2. If flagged after extraction: Add folder to Windows Defender exclusions
  3. Windows Security → Virus & threat protection → Exclusions → Add folder

  Solution 3: Alternative Packaging

  Option A: Create MSI Installer Instead of ZIP
  # Use WiX Toolset to create proper installer
  # MSI installers are less likely to be flagged

  Option B: Self-Extracting Archive with Certificate
  - Use tools like 7-Zip SFX or WinRAR SFX
  - Sign the self-extractor

  Solution 4: Distribution Method Changes

  Option A: Windows Store
  - No extraction needed
  - Automatic trust

  Option B: Direct Download (Not Zipped)
  - Host the signed executable directly
  - Users download .exe instead of .zip

  Solution 5: Add Digital Signature to ZIP Metadata

  Some antivirus software respects ZIP file signatures.

  Immediate User Workaround Instructions:

  Create a README_WINDOWS_SECURITY.txt file:

  WINDOWS SECURITY NOTICE
  =======================

  If Windows Defender blocks Orchetrix after extraction:

  METHOD 1 - Before Extracting:
  1. Right-click the downloaded ZIP file
  2. Select "Properties"
  3. Check "Unblock" at the bottom
  4. Click "OK"
  5. Now extract the ZIP file

  METHOD 2 - After Extraction:
  1. Open Windows Security
  2. Go to "Virus & threat protection"
  3. Click "Manage settings" under Real-time protection
  4. Click "Add or remove exclusions"
  5. Add the Orchetrix folder as an exclusion

  METHOD 3 - Restore from Quarantine:
  1. Open Windows Security
  2. Go to "Protection history"
  3. Find Orchetrix in the list
  4. Click "Actions" → "Restore"

  This is a false positive. Orchetrix is safe Kubernetes management software.

  The code signing certificate is still your best long-term solution, but these workarounds will help users in the meantime.
